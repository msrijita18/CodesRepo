that every sequence of consecutive blank spaces is replaced by a single space.

           char c; 
           ifstream inf("santo.txt");      // open a text document file named “santo” to read. 
           inf.get(c);                            // retrieve  a single character  from “santo” file. 
 
           while(inf)      // is character is ‘/0’  ? if not  go inside loop 
             { 
 
                         if(c==' ')  // is character is a space? If yes  execute “if” statement.

                                            inf.get(c); // retrieve  a single character from “santo” file.

                                                  break;        // this is just for skip  the space. 
                                            } 
                                     } 
                                 of<<" ";         // write single space to “hasib”  text document file. 
                                 of<<c;         // write  next charcter to “hasib”  text document file. 
 
    } 
                     else 
                     of<<c;              // write  single character where no space exits. 
                    inf.get(c);      // retrieve a single character from “santo” text document again. 
          } 
    return 0; 
} 
 
 
Note: Before you run this program you just create a ‘.txt’ document to a particular drive where 
your compiler was installed. 
 
 
11.2  A file contains a list of telephone numbers in the following form 
John          23456 
Ahmed       9876 
……………       ………… 
the names contain only one word and the names and telephone numbers are separated by white 
spaces. Write program to read this file and output the list in two columns. The names should be 
left justified and the numbers should be right justified.
